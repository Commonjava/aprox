title: "AProx Add-Ons"
---

AProx provides the following add-ons, which appear in various deployment flavors. All add-ons are available in the `savant` deployment flavor.

**NOTE:** While many of these add-ons are listed as stable, you should remember that AProx is considered a pre-1.0 project. As such, it's possible these add-ons may be refactored prior to the 1.0 release without preserving backward compatibility. Refactoring events this large should be rare, but you've been warned!
