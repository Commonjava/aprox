### Gross Anatomy of AProx

Broadly speaking, AProx's architecture consists of several types of code:

* [Core API and Implementation](core.html)
* Object models
* Subsystems
* Add-Ons
* Client APIs
* Service Bindings
* UIs

These are the categories we'll discuss below in greater detail. However, if you've looked at the project directory structure, you'll notice other directories and project modules (POMs). Going beyond the architecture itself, AProx also contains the following additional types of project modules:

* Embedders
* Deployments
* Test fixtures
* Functional tests
* Functional test execution points
* Build tools

These modules are out of scope for this section of the developer's guide. For more information, see: [Project Layout](layout.html).
